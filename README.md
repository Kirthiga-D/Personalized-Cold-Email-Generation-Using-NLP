# Personalized-Cold-Email-Generation-Using-NLP


This paper presents the development
of a cold email generation tool designed to automate
and personalize recruitment outreach. The tool leverages
job listings and candidate portfolios as primary data
sources, processing this information using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system
matches job descriptions with relevant candidate profiles
and generates personalized cold emails tailored to each
candidate. Through extensive testing, the tool demonstrates
promising performance in key areas including job extraction, portfolio matching, and email engagement. The
results suggest that the tool can significantly streamline
the recruitment process by enhancing personalization and
efficiency in outreach efforts, with potential applications
in automating and optimizing talent acquisition strategies
